Sea Battle Extreme was our final advanced programming project created using QT 6.7. It is based on the concept of the original game Sea Battle, featuring both a vs. bot mode and a co-op mode for playing with friends on the same device. 
If you encounter any issues in the vs bot or co-op mode, please inform us.

Enjoy!
